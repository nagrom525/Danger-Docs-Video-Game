We need at least one cooperative surgery

Sounds effects throughout entire game.

I think everything broke.

Don't force them to click to restart

We're seeing some build only bugs.

---- Tutorial Planning (Gamma)

- Improve Dashing Affordence / Signaling

- Dash to get rid of raccoons as well as bear.

- Make it more obvious that the dash is working on the bear.

- Require all players to work together on bear

- Display graphic to explicitly instruct player

- Progress bar (for player progress through task and tutorial overall)

- Tutorial Events controller
    + Maintain state for tutorial
    + Monitor progress

- Spawning Controller
    + Handles timing of the spawning

- Table by the patient

- Transitions!
    + Cannot have people using the mouse

## Tutorial Order

1. Pickup a random tool
1. Spawn each type of surgery step
1. Each player completes a different surgery step
  + Somewhat of a forces specialization
1. Teach anestetic machine
1. Teach heart attack
  + To just one person
1. Teach raccoon
1. Teach bear
