# Danger Docs - Video Game

This was a 4-person project, where we worked together to make a vertical slice (around 5 minutes) of a 4 person co-op game.

Unfortunately you need all **4 players** in order to enjoy the game but I promise it is worth it! We spent quite a while on both the visual and audio assets as well as the mechanics, so we hope you enjoy it!

## Concept

You have been dispatched to the woods in order to perform a lifesaving surgery. But watch out, you may be faced with Raccoons, Forest Fires, and even one very hungry bear!
